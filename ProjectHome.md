## Primary Objective ##

Study Fractal Geometry and use Fractal Dimension to implement better clustering algorithm.

  * Our initial goal is to implement method mention in "Using Fractal Dimension to Cluster Datasets by Daniel Barbara and Ping Chen"

  * Based on our research findings during above task, we will suggest an improved technique for better clustering using Fractal Dimensions.

  * We will also compare implementation of the initial goal against minimum spanning tree.
